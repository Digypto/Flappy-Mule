## Flappy Mule
This is a hobby project done for fun and practicing different aspects and libraries of Python.

## Installing libraries and running the game

The needed libraries and their versions are written in requirements.txt. These can be installed by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" on terminal in correct directory. The game can be run e.g. with the command "Python Flappy-Mule.py" on terminal.
